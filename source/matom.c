                                    Imperial College London
Synopsis:
	Matom is the core of the implementation of Leon Lucy's Macro Atom
	approach to dealing with radiation-matter interactions. It is called whenever
	a photon packet activates a macro atom. As input it takes the process by
	which activation occurred (identified by the label "nres") which allow it 
	to deduce the level that has been excited. It then calculates all the 
	Macro Atom jumping/deactivaion probabilities following Lucy and so deduces
	the process by which deactivation occurs. At output "nres" identifies this 
	process and the packet information has been updates. 

Arguments:

       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom
  
Returns:
       int nres                    the process by which deactivation occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following deactivation
       int escape                  to tell us whether the de-activation of the
                                   macro atom is via an r-packet (escape = 1) or
                                   a k-packet (escape = 0)

Description:


Notes: 

ksl-- There is a lot of arithmetic required to keep track of indices.  I would
be inclined to figure out a way to avoid this.  One possibility would be to record the
go_to level in an array when one is calculating the emission probabilities. This would
make it easier to add new processes, I suspect. 

It would be possible to convert the for loop to a while statement.  This would avoid the
break statement in the middle.  

History:
          Feb 04  SS   Coding began.
          Mar 04  SS   Minor changes made (based on comments from ksl)
	04apr	ksl	A. Eliminated some unnecessary if statements.  These are indicated
			by the words extra.  Stuart should remove the lines assuming he
			agrees.
			B. Changed the logic of the major do loop so that the break is moved
			higher in the do loop.  Stuart, the intent is to make the
			code more readable, and to reduce the level of nesting. 
			C. Corrected an errror that on upward bb transitions seemed to leave
			the macro-atom in the same state as previously.
			D. Shamelessly modified some of the comments to make it more
			straightforward for me to understand.
			E. m = m + 1 --> m++ in several places
			F. Modified selections to allow simple lines to be read in but
			not to affect matom.  nlines_macro is the number on macro-lines
			read in and these are the first elements in the line structure
			G. Modified the way matom determines that a transition is a photo
			ionization transition bo be consitent with change made in
			resonate.
          Apr 04   SS   Modifications to include collisional jumps/deactivation included.
          May 04   SS   Bug corrected for identification of line (nres is the place of the
                        line in the ORDERED list, not the input list).
          Jun 04   SS   Modified to carry the "escape" variable to identify de-activation
                        via r-packets and k-packets - avoids the need to call kpkt from
                        within this routine
          Jun 04   SS   Adding collisional ionization as an upwards jump possibility. No collisional
                        recombination for the moment.
          Jun 04   SS   Now putting in collisional recombination too.
          July04   SS   Modifying so that this routine does not call alpha_sp but rather uses 
                        pre-computed (stored values) for the spontaneous recombination coefficient.
                        This is an effort to speed up the code.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Adapted for use with plsama structure.  Changed call to
			eliminate passing entire w array
	06jun	ksl	57g -- Split macro variables into a separate structure. The structue
			which is createdin gridwind, is only created if there are macroatoms.
	06jul	ksl	57h -- In the process of speeding up the program in the simple 
			non-macro atom case, I tried to make sure that matom and the 
			derivative routiens were not called at all.  Note that at present
			the macroatom case is quite slow, due to what is happening in
			matom.  I am suspicious that it could be speeded up a lot.
        07jul     SS    Experimenting with retaining jumping/emission probabilities to save time.

Description:


Notes: 


History:
          Mar 04  SS   Coding began.
          Apr 04  SS   Various improvements including the addition of ff and collisions.
          May 04  SS   Minor changes made to collisional cooling rates (bug fixed)
                       and fb cooling for simple continua.
          May 04  SS   Modified to work for case with all "simple" ions.
          May 04  SS   Modified to use "scattering probability" formalism for 
                       simple ion cooling rates.
          Jun 04  SS   Modified to include the "escape" variable to identify excitation of
                       macro atoms. This removes the need to call matom from within this routine.
          Jun 04  SS   Modified to include collisional ionization as a cooling term.
          July04  SS   Modified to use recomb_sp(_e) rather than alpha_sp(_e) to speed up.
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Modified to use new plasma array.  Eliminated passing

Synopsis:
       fake_matom_bb is the macro atom routine that deals with line events involving
       simple ions (i.e. ions for which a full macro atom treatment is not employed.
       When this routine is called a simple line has absorbed a packet. This routine 
       creates a fake two-level macro atom and determines whether the packet energy
       is simply re-emitted in the line or is thermalised. If it is thermalised it
       turns into a k-packet and the appropriate routine is called. 


Arguments:

       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom

Returns:
       int nres                    the process by which deactivation occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following deactivation
       int escape                  identifies whether the macro atom deactivated via an
                                   r-packet (escape = 1) or a k-packet (escape = 0). If
                                   a k-packet then the call to this routine should be
                                   followed by a call to kpkt.

Synopsis:
       fake_matom_bf is the macro atom routine that deals with photoionisation 
       events involving simple ions (i.e. ions for which a full macro atom treatment 
       is not employed).
       When this routine is called a photoionisation has absorbed a packet. 
       The idea of this routine is to deal with the subsequenct
       by creating a fake two-level atom. 
       However, in the absense of collisional recombination (or something
       similar) there's only one thing that can happen - radiative 
       recombination. Therefore there's no need to do anything here unless
       collisional recombination is to be introduced at some point in the
       future.
       All this routine does for now is choose a new frequency for the 
       emitted r-packet.


Arguments:

       WindPtr w                   the ptr to the structure defining the wind
       PhotPtr p                   the packet at the point of activation
       int nres                    the process which activates the Macro Atom

Returns:
       int nres                    the process by which deactivation occurs
       PhotPtr p                   the packet following deactivation
       int escape                  in principle this tells us whether de-activation is
                                   via an r-packet or a k-packet. For this routine at the 
                                   moment only r-packets are possible so it always returns
